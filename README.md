# Halite2StarterCSharp
Halite 2 starter project in C#

Copy halite.exe into Halite2 directory and run the batch file to start.

This is just the java project blindly converted to C#. Many TODOs still including code clean up, renaming of functions and variables to C# standards and maybe some other enhancements.

Instructions on how to debug using Visual Studio to come soon as well.
